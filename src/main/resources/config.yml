# WARNING:
# 1. Firstly, KML doesn't support the id ("magic value") of the material (a number instead of the name) because
# it deprecated and may be removed in 1.13 (e.g: 277, 5, 30, 1, etc)
# 2. And you must use a unique id for each config group of item (a group which has two options are "name" and
# "value").
# 3. Use "MATERIAL_DATA" type for a group which has the value formats from both a material and a data value
# (e.g: 277:1, 277:2, etc).
